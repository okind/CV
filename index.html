          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>I studied math and programming at school. I was attending afterschool programming class since 8th grade in middle school. 
            I continued my course with high education and got a Master’s degree in Math and Computer science.
             Now I have a plenty of software development experience on several languages, Python and Java are mostly preferred. At my first job, at CQG being in a role of software engineer, 
             I participated in every phase of software development life cycle: requirements gathering, coding, testing, deploying, technical support and customer trainings. 
             It gave me an understanding how entire IT industry work.

          <h3>Coaching</h3>
          <p>As I love doing things efficiently I participated in an internal company initiative in a role of scrum master/process coach for development process improvement. 
            I was helping to improve tools - dashboards that were collecting, extracting, analyzing and visualizing data on development teams performance. 
            During this work I was obsessed of how key data insights/metrics helped to improve our development productivity.</p>
